# Railway Quick Fix - Deploy Now!

## The Problem
Railway was using the wrong start command and failing repeatedly.

## The Solution
I've created `railway_fix.py` - a super simple bot that will work immediately on Railway.

## Files to Deploy

### 1. Main Bot: `railway_fix.py`
- âœ… Super simple code
- âœ… No complex dependencies
- âœ… Health check at `/health`
- âœ… Background Telegram bot
- âœ… Works immediately

### 2. Requirements: `requirements.txt`
```
python-telegram-bot==20.7
flask==3.0.0
```

### 3. Procfile
```
web: python railway_fix.py
```

### 4. Railway Config: `railway.json`
```json
{
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "python railway_fix.py",
    "healthcheckPath": "/health"
  }
}
```

## How to Fix on Railway

### Option 1: Update Files in Railway
1. **Go to your Railway project**
2. **Replace these files**:
   - Upload `railway_fix.py`
   - Update `requirements.txt`
   - Update `Procfile`
   - Update `railway.json`
3. **Set environment variables**:
   ```
   TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=7822967965:AAGMau39Np0kF0brpKz_qYIdgBBzXeZzQ5E
   ENCRYPTION_KEY=PolyFocus2024SecureKey32Char
   ```
4. **Redeploy**

### Option 2: Update GitHub and Redeploy
1. **Update your GitHub repository** with the new files
2. **Railway will auto-deploy** the changes

## Environment Variables

Set these in Railway dashboard:

```

## Health Check

- **URL**: `https://your-app.railway.app/health`
- **Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "polyfocus-bot",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "bot": "@Polymarketsolanabot"
}
```

## Test Your Bot

1. **Health Check**: Visit your Railway app URL + `/health`

## Why This Will Work

âœ… **Super Simple**: Minimal code, no complex imports
